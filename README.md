# Multi Objective Optimization for Hydraulic Fracture Design on Shale Gas Reservoir

## General Information
This repository contains research and code dedicated to optimizing hydraulic fracture designs in unconventional shale gas reservoirs. By leveraging the PyMOO library, a powerful Python-based multi-objective optimization tool, the project refines key fracture parameters to balance production performance and operational costs.

Key Features:
- Data-Driven Optimization: Uses simulation data generated from tNavigator to capture fracture responses.
- Multi-Objective Approach: Optimize to minimize water production rate and maximize gas production rate.
- Python-Based Workflow: Fully integrated with Python, allowing for flexible customization and easy experimentation with different optimization algorithms.
